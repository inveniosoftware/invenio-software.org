<h1>Governance</h1>
<div class="centered">
  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    The current governance model is being revised as part of the <a href="/products/rdm/">InvenioRDM project</a>.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
    Invenio is governed by CERN for the benefit of the community. CERN strives to
  make Invenio a collaborative, open and transparent project to ensure that
  everyone can contribute and have their say on the directions of the project.
  <br/><br/>
  Invenio governance is in general informal and we try to strike a balance
  between processes and agreed upon standards vs. the wild west where everyone do
  as they see fit. The governance model is intended to allow that people
  progressively take larger and larger responsibilities with support from the
  existing leadership.
  <br/><br/>
  These following sections define the different roles and responsibilities in the
  project, define how decisions are taken and how people are appointed to
  different roles. Overall, we expect every person who participates in the
  project to adhere to our <a href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>
<h1>Roles and responsibilities</h1>
<p>
  The <strong>product manager</strong>, <strong>coordinators</strong>, <strong>architects</strong> and <strong>maintainers</strong> (as
  defined below) make up the leadership of Invenio. The leaders of Invenio are
  <strong>service people</strong> who:
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li>take an active role in driving the project forward</li>
    <li>help newcomers as well as long-time contributors have a great experience contributing to Invenio</li>
    <li>help train members to progressively take larger responsibility in the project</li>
    <li>are role models for the remaining community</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Members</strong>: Anyone using Invenio.</li>
    <li><strong>Contributors</strong>: Anyone contributing to Invenio (in it widest possible
  interpretation, i.e. not only programmers).</li>
    <li><strong>Maintainers</strong>: Anyone maintaining at least one repository. Maintainers are
  responsible for managing the issues and/or the code base of a repository
  according to Invenio's standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Architects</strong>: Anyone maintaining 20+ repositories (though max 10 people).
  Architects are responsible for the overall Invenio technical architecture as
  well as managing and training maintainers on their respective repositories.</li>
    <li><strong>Coordinators</strong>: Representatives of Invenio based services that would like
  to coordinate their Invenio development efforts with other services and
  provide input on the product road map.</li>
    <li><strong>Product manager</strong>: Overall responsible for Invenio's vision, strategy and
  day-to-day management. Responsible for managing and training architects and
  coordinators.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Commit access on repositories are given to contributors, maintainers and
  architects. Contributors can commit/merge to feature branches while only
  maintainers and architects can commit/merge to master/maintenance branches
  (meaning also only they can release packages to PyPI and NPM).
</p>

<h1>Decision making</h1>
<p>
We strive to take decisions openly and by consensus, though ultimately CERN
represented by the Invenio product manager has the final say on all decisions
in the project. In particular this means that there is no formal voting
procedure for Invenio.
</p>

<h3>Leaders drive decision making</h3>
<p>
The Invenio product manager, architects, coordinators and maintainers as the
leaders of the project are responsible for driving decision making in their
respective domains.
</p>
<p>
Driving decision making means:
  <ul>
    <li>facilitating an open constructive discussion around a decision that matches
    the level of importance and impact of a decision,</li>
    <li>striving for reaching consensus on a decision and ensuring relevant other
    members are aware and included on the decision,</li>
    <li>ensuring decisions are in alignment with the overall Invenio vision,
    strategy, architecture and standards,</li>
    <li>coordinating the decision with the Invenio leadership (product manager,
    architects and coordinators),</li>
    <li>taking the decision.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Leaders implement decisions</h3>

<p>Leaders are responsible for following up decisions they take by actual
implementation. Decision should not be considered final unless it is
actually implemented or documented publicly.</p>

<h3>Disagreements</h3>
<p>
Leaders of the project should always strive for consensus. If that is not
possible the leader taking a decision should alert the Invenio product manager
prior to taking the decision.
<br/><br/>
Members who are disagreeing with a decision may ask the product manager to
review a specific decision and possible change it.
<br/><br/>
Members who are disagreeing with the Invenio product manager may escalate the
product manager's decision to their hierarchy at CERN.
</p>

<h1>Appointments</h1>
<p>
The Invenio product manager is appointed by CERN. Architects, coordinators and
maintainers are appointed by the Invenio product manager in collaboration with
existing architects and coordinators.
<br/><br/>
Maintainers are appointed by the architects (e.g. a new Invenio module) or
coordinators (e.g. a new special interest group).
<br/><br/>
In general, appointments are made in an informal way, and usually anyone
volunteering that have been showing commitment to the project will get
appointed. Any member can volunteer or suggest other members for roles.
</p>

<h3>Revoking of appointed roles</h3>
<p>
The product manager may revoke appointed roles of a member for reasons such as
(but not limitied to):
<ul>
  <li>lack of activity</li>
  <li>violations of the code of conduct</li>
  <li>repeated infringements of the contribution, style or maintainer guides.</li>
</ul>
The product manager must give a warning to the member to allow them to correct
their behavior except in severe cases. Revoking roles should be a last measure,
and only serve the purpose to ensure that Invenio has a healthy community and
collaboration based on our <a href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<h1>Working/Interest groups</h1>
<a name="code-of-conduct"></a>
<p>
Working/interest groups may be set up by the product manager on request of any
group of members who wish to address a particular area of Invenio (say MARC21
support or research data management). Working/interest groups help coordinate
the overall vision, strategy and architecture of a specific area of Invenio.
Each working/interest group must have chair that reports to the product
manager.
</p>


<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>
  We endorse the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python Community Code of Conduct</a>:
       The Invenio community is made up of members from around the globe
       with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.  It is
       through these differences that our community experiences great
       successes and continued growth.  When you're working with members of
       the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which
       help steer our interactions and strive to keep Invenio a positive,
       successful, and growing community.

  A member of the Invenio community is:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Open.</strong> Members of the community are open to collaboration,
    whether it's on RFCs, patches, problems, or otherwise.  We're
    receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences
    and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our
    efforts.  We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our
    activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate
    and everyone can make a difference.</li>

    <li><strong>Considerate.</strong> Members of the community are considerate of
    their peers -- other Invenio users.  We're thoughtful when
    addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times
    the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
    We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online,
    and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</li>

    <li><strong>Respectful.</strong> Members of the community are respectful.  We're
    respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their
    commitments, and their efforts.  We're respectful of the volunteer
    efforts that permeate the Invenio community.  We're respectful of
    the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
    When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.</li>
  </ol>
  <br/><br/>
  Overall, we're good to each other.  We contribute to this community
  not because we have to, but because we want to.  If we remember
  that, these guidelines will come naturally.
